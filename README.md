# PI-Matrix-Dash-HA

This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a 32x64 LED matrix, and an Adafruit HAT to create a real-time dashboard that displays data from local RESTful API endpoints.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a compact, yet informative, LED matrix display that can be used to monitor and visualize data from various sources. The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W serves as the brain of the system, interfacing with the LED matrix and fetching data from local RESTful API endpoints.

The project is designed to be a versatile and customizable solution, allowing users to display a wide range of information, such as:

- Real-time metrics and statistics
- Notifications and alerts
- Graphical representations of data
- Custom visualizations and animations

By leveraging the power of the Raspberry Pi and the flexibility of the LED matrix, this project aims to provide a compact and efficient way to monitor and display important information in a visually appealing manner.

## Key Features

- Integration with local RESTful API endpoints for data retrieval
- Customizable data visualization and display options
- Efficient and responsive LED matrix rendering
- Compact and space-saving design using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Easily extensible and configurable to suit various use cases

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need the following hardware components:

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- 32x64 LED matrix
- Adafruit HAT for Raspberry Pi

Additionally, you'll need to set up the necessary software and dependencies, including the rpi-rgb-led-matrix library and the required RESTful API endpoints.

Detailed instructions for setting up the hardware, configuring the software, and integrating the RESTful API data sources will be provided in the project's documentation.

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to the project if you have any suggestions or improvements!
